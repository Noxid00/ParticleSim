ParticleSim is an N-Particle gravity simulation that accounts for momentum and collisions
The simulation is plotted on a 3d scatterplot that scales based on the initial distribution parameters

To run the simulation, open the ParticleSim.py using pyhton with matplotlib and numpy installed

Current Features:
Variable number of particles
Variable particle properties
Option for random initial velocities
Option for Average velocity and Center of Mass plots

Number of particles and other parameters can be modified by modifying the lines in ParticleSim.py marked "PARAMS"
